    <div id="description" class="col-xxs-12">A caffè latte (commonly referred to as a Latte) is a coffee drink, made with a shot of espresso, steamed milk, and it’s topped with a milk microfoam layer of around 0.2 to 0.4 inches (0.5 to 1 cm). Making up around two-thirds of the drink, the key component of the latte is the milk which needs to be evenly heated and without an excess of foam. This is achieved by introducing less air into the milk during the heating process by placing the steam arm a little bit deeper, to avoid too much air being dragged into the liquid. The simplest drink to prepare, an espresso is a single shot of coffee, usually served in a small demitasse cup. The term short black is used interchangeably with espresso, although I have heard of people adding extra hot water when a short black is ordered. Recently, cafes have started to experiment with the cups the espresso is served in. An espresso served in a wider cup or glass allows more aroma to reach the drinker, whilst serving the espresso in a room-temperature, or even chilled, cup will drop the temperature of the coffee faster and create a different sensory experience.
